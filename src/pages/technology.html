          <p class="technology-description">Hologic QDR-4500c has the combination of the superiority of fan-beam technology with a unique, value-added package of clinical, patient reporting, and support software. Hologic QDR-4500c uses a user-friendly operating system that provides step-by-step instructions through the examination process with accurate results at the push of a button. The unit is nearly five times faster than the time it takes to produce similar, clinically-meaningful scans than the fastest pencil-beam system. This fast scanning method allows you to contribute to your potential for practice growth and can accommodate more patients in your busy schedule.</p>
